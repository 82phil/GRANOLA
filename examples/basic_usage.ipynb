Each [Command Reader](https://granola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_readers.html) receives a serial command and then returns a response. Any given [Command Reader](https://granola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_readers.html) is free to process that command in any way that is so chooses. \n",

    "[Canned Queries](https://granola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config/canned_queries.html) is a type of [Command Reader](https://granola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_readers.html) that takes a command and loops through a list of responses for that command. It can loop through those responses in order or randomly. [Canned Queries](https://granola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config/canned_queries.html) also by default loop back to the beginning of their list of responses when they reach the end.\n",

    "- `StickCannedQueries` is a Hook that will take specified [Canned Queries](https://granola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config/canned_queries.html) commands, and once the command has exhausted all of its responses, all future queries of that command will only return the last response. A practical example of this might be a serial command of some measurement that is approaching a value, such as a temperature reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ApproachHook` is a Hook that works with [Getters and Setters](https://granola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config/getters_and_setters.html) commands, and allows you to set a new value for a command, but instead of the value being instantly set, it is set over time, allowing you slowly approach that value. This can be practical for a simulating a device that is controlling the temperature of some chamber, but when you set it, it takes a while to warm up."
